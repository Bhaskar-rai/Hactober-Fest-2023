A priori and a posteriori are terms that used especially in logic and philosophy.
A priori is from Latin ā priōrī, which means literally, "from what is earlier." A priori knowledge is knowledge that comes from the power of reasoning based on self-evident truths;
a priori usually describes lines of reasoning or arguments that proceed from the general to the particular, or from causes to effects.
A posteriori is from Latin ā posteriōrī, which means literally, "from what is later." It describes knowledge based solely on experience or personal observation.
So, for example, "Every apple is a fruit" is an a priori statement, since it shows simple logical reasoning and isn't a statement of fact about a specific case; "apples are sweet" is a posteriori,
as it expresses something the speaker knows from experience.
